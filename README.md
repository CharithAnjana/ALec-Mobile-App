# ALec
ALec is a versatile mobile and web application designed to tackle the challenges of low student engagement and interaction within the classroom. Its primary goal is to create an interactive learning environment that fosters active participation and enhances the overall learning experience.

With ALec, lecturers are empowered to incorporate small quizzes during their lectures. Students can easily answer these quizzes using their smartphones, providing real-time feedback on their comprehension and knowledge of the lecture material. This valuable insight allows lecturers to evaluate student understanding and make necessary adjustments to their teaching approach.

In addition to quizzes, ALec offers an anonymous question-asking feature. Students can submit questions through the app without revealing their identity, encouraging even the most reserved individuals to actively engage and contribute to class discussions. This promotes inclusivity and encourages a vibrant exchange of ideas.

ALec also provides a platform for self-evaluation through its leaderboard and review system. Students can evaluate their progress, track their performance, and identify areas for improvement. This self-assessment component motivates students to pay closer attention to course content and take an active role in their learning journey.

The web application of ALec is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. These technologies ensure a robust and reliable foundation for seamless web functionality. On the other hand, the mobile app is developed using Java and XML, leveraging the power of these languages to deliver a native and user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

By strengthening the interaction between lecturers and students, ALec enhances efficiency and popularity for both parties. Lecturers gain valuable insights into student understanding, while students benefit from an engaging and personalized learning experience. ALec revolutionizes traditional classroom dynamics, empowering learners and creating a positive impact on the overall learning outcomes.
